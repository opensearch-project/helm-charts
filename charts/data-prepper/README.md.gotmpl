Data Prepper is an essential component of the OpenSearch project, designed for high-volume data transformation and ingestion into OpenSearch. This Helm chart simplifies deploying Data Prepper on Kubernetes environments, ensuring you can easily set up your data processing pipelines.

## Requirements

Before installing the Data Prepper Helm chart, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

* Kubernetes >= 1.14
* Helm >= 2.17.0
* We recommend having at least 4 GiB of memory available for this deployment. A minimum of 2 GiB may suffice, but less than that could lead to deployment failures.

## Installation

To install the Data Prepper Helm chart, follow these steps:

* Add the OpenSearch Helm repository if you haven't already:

```bash
helm repo add opensearch https://opensearch-project.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
```

* Install the Data Prepper chart with:

```bash
helm install my-data-prepper-release opensearch/data-prepper
```

Replace my-data-prepper-release with your desired release name. When no explicit pipeline is defined, this will configure a demo pipeline using a random source and stdout sink.

## Configuration

The Data Prepper Helm chart comes with a variety of configuration options to tailor the deployment to your needs.
The default values are specified in the [values.yaml](values.yaml) file. You can override these values by providing your own `values.yaml` file during installation or by specifying configuration options with --set flags.

For a detailed list of configuration options, refer to the values.yaml file or the [Data Prepper documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/data-prepper/managing-data-prepper/configuring-data-prepper/).

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the my-data-prepper deployment:

```bash
helm delete my-data-prepper
```

This command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
